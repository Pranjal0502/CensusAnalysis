# CensusAnalysis
This project explores census data through SQL queries to uncover meaningful insights about population trends, demographics, literacy, and employment. 
By leveraging SQLâ€™s power in data aggregation, filtering, and joins, 
the analysis transforms raw census tables into clear patterns and comparisons that highlight social and economic structures.
